# i3
i3-gaps with picom, dunst, polybar and sometimes lightdm

## Notes for all of these:
* I will probably miss some dependencies for the distro's. Please forgive me...
* Please don't just copy everything, I am working on this stuff and I will make a script sometime. Idempotency is hard at times.
* You can do whatever the /**** you want with these dotfiles.

### Notes:
* Install dependencies from `void/pkgs.txt`.

## Arch GNU/Linux

### Notes:
* A lot is already installed, please do your own research since I have a custom image which supplies everything to me, and I am not going to share for reasons.
