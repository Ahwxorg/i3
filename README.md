# i3
i3-gaps with picom, dunst, polybar and sometimes lightdm

## Notes for all of these:
* I will probably miss some dependencies for the distro's. Please forgive me...
* Please don't just copy everything, I am working on this stuff and I will make a script sometime. Idempotency is hard at times.
* You can do whatever the /**** you want with these dotfiles.
* All of these use [my own version of the st terminal](https://github.com/Ahwxorg/pt), made by suckless.
* I use Firefox or Librewolf as browser.
* I generally spend about 70% of my time in a terminal, so there isn't really anything interesting other than that, except for that I need a status bar and stuff to be productive since issues with info and tray and other stuff otherwise.
* Generally my background color is: #1e222a.

### Notes:
* A lot is already installed, please do your own research since I have a custom image which supplies everything to me, and I am not going to share for reasons.
